    <li class="project-title"> Elucidating histopathological characteristics of brains in SHRSP, model of Cerebral Small Vessel Disease, with a focus on hypoxia.</li>
    <p class="abstract"> Cerebral small vessel disease refers to a group of slowly progressing diseases that affect the small blood vessels in the brain, with several underlying pathological processes. It is associated with changes in the cerebral microvasculature, perfusion deficits, as well as the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. This study aimed to examine the changes in the vasculature, pericyte coverage and tissue vulnerability to hypoxia in brain sections of spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats (SHRSP), an animal model of human small vessel disease. Immunohistochemical methods were used to visualize the vasculature and examine the presence of hypoxia in the cell types of interest. Hypertension-induced vascular remodelling and neuronal vulnerability to hypoxia were identified in the brains of SHRSP animals. Although the study did not reveal differences in the pericyte coverage between hypertensive and normotensive animals, these findings may still offer an insight into the pathological mechanisms pericytes are involved in.</p>

    <li class="project-title">A critical review of the Amyloid Hypothesis in Alzheimer’s Disease Pathogenesis.</li>
    <p class="abstract">The Amyloid hypothesis has been the dominant aetiology for Alzheimer’s-type dementia for the past three decades. It proposes an excessive accumulation of Aβ peptides and the deposition of them into insoluble fibrillar plaques around the neurons, surrounded by a halo of neurotoxic oligomeric assemblies. Recent studies have pointed out Aβ oligomers as the neurotoxic agents, while suggesting that the senile plaques function as inactive reservoirs, in equilibrium with the oligomeric assemblies. In addition to this new therapeutic target, other possible pathways have started to shift the attention away from the Amyloid hypothesis. Despite this, no drugs that target Αβ have passed the clinical trials, suggesting an inability to administrate drugs early enough and a generally fault approach to the cause of Alzheimer’s Disease. My BSc research project, titled "A critical review of the Amyloid Hypothesis in Alzheimer’s Disease Pathogenesis", was a review of this hypothesis. With respect to its pathology and molecular basis, I evaluated how strong it stands against its counterparts. Moreover, recommendations for future approaches to the disease’s prevention were made, including the need for a personalized risk score and improved sampling techniques for biomarkers.
